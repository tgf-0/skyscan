// # SKYSCAN: Realtime Location Coordinate System
// Requires 3 Nav Recievers
// Controls receiver, scanning and storing coordinates.
// Nav receivers should be on `frequency:1` and `listenangle:180`
// Nav receivers should rename message field to nsig, esig and wsig
// Nav receivers should rename SignalStrength fields to nss, ess and wss
// Nav receivers should add values of TargetMessage to "origin_north", "origin_east", and "origin_west"
// A Text Panel with device field `:Location`
// Do not run SkyScan-Display.yolol concurrently, this script will handle its own display.
// Memory chip must be default named (`ChipField1`, `ChipField2`, etc)
// - CF1 is Origin North
// - CF2 is Origin East
// - CF3 is Origin West
// - CF4 is Scan index (for matching coords to a scan run)
// If running locmark.yolol:
// - CF5 is Saved Location 1 Origin North
// - CF6 is Saved Location 1 Origin East
// - CF7 is Saved Location 1 Origin West
// - CF8 is Saved Location 2 Origin North
// - CF9 is Saved Location 2 Origin East
// - CF10 is Saved Location 2 Origin West


// Realtime is inaccurate with a single receiver because of how slow YOLOL chips are.
// Apparently a signal can be lost or replaced by another signal before that signal's can be captured by YOLOL ops
